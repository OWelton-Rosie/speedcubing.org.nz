    The World Cube Association (WCA) is the governing body for speedcubing worldwide. 
    The <a href="https://worldcubeassociation.org" target="_blank">WCA website</a> is where you can find all 
    the details for a particular competition, where you register for competitions, and where 
    you can find all the results and records from previous competitions. <br><br>The WCA appoints 
    delegates, who are responsible for making sure that all competitions are run according to 
    the WCA’s mission, <a href="https://documents.worldcubeassociation.org/documents/motions/01.2025.1%20-%20Spirit.pdf" target="_blank">spirit</a> and <a href="https://www.worldcubeassociation.org/regulations/" target="_blank">
    regulations</a>. There will be at least one WCA delegate at every competition, and 
    they’re good people to ask for help if you’re confused about anything!
