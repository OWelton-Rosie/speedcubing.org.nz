 <p>
  The most important thing is practice! Beyond that though, 
  we have event-specific resources listed <a href="../getting-started#events_info">here</a>. 
  There are also a variety of paid coaching services available from international sites 
  like <a href="https://cubing.gg">cubing.gg</a> and <a href="https://cubing.life">
  Cubing Life Academy</a> if you want to take your cubing to the next level. One of the best 
  ways to get free advice though is to come to a competition and meet fellow cubers!
